# Portfolio App Tutorial with Django
This is the first of our Year 2 Star Coders sessions!  
The goal will be to get familiar with using Git and Github and begin a starter Portfolio web applicatoin using Django and Postgres.  
In future sessions we will build out this application and deploy it to an actual website using Heroku!  

This project is taken from this [RealPython tutorial](https://realpython.com/get-started-with-django-1/) by Jasmine Fisher.


## Git + Environment Setup
### Python
[Install Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)   
Make sure you have Python version 3.4 at a minimum. I am currently using Version 3.9.7.  
You can find out which python version you have installed (and IF it is installed) by opening a shell (terminal on Mac or Powershell/command prompt in Windows) and executing the following command: `python3 --version`. 

### Git  
[Git Cheat Sheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf )  
[Installing Git On You Machine](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)  
[Git How To](https://githowto.com/)  
[Atlassian Git Tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials)  
[Github Guides](https://guides.github.com/)  


1. The first step is to install Git. If Git is already installed on your machine, sign up for your own account on Github.com. 
2. Fork this repository into your own account. 
3. Clone the *new forked repo* onto your local machine.

On your own time, explore open source repositories on Github! There are many ongoing projects that need help. Forking repositories, fixing small issues, and sending over your fixes with pull requests is a great way to gain experience and reputation in Github. There are also a lot of beginner oriented projects to help you get started.  
Check out the [First Contributions](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions) project.  


### IDE
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)  
[PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/installation-guide.html#toolbox)  

1. Install either VSCode or Pycharm if you have not already done so (any other editor is fine as well, these are just recommended).
2. Open your project and make a change to the README.txt file, commit that change, push up that change to your repository in Github.
3. Open up the project in Github, make a change to the README.txt file in Github directly. Then pull that change down using `git pull` on your machine.  


### Postgres  
[Install Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)  
[Postgres Docs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/)  
[Postgres Basics](https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/postgres-basics)  

1. Install Postgres if it is not already installed on your machine. Follow the link above.  
2. Start up the default Postgres server and database (the default should be named just 'postgres')  
3. If you add a User and Password to your default database after installing, then make sure to add those credentials in the DATABASES dict object in `settings.py`.  


### Django  
[Django Docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/)  
[Django Model Field References](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/models/fields/)  
[Video Overview of Django Portfolio Project](https://realpython.com/courses/django-portfolio-project/)  

Make sure you have python 3.4 or higher installed. You can verify the version with the following command: `python --version` or `python3 --version`.  
If your `python --version` is already at 3.4+, then use `python` instead of `python3` in the following commands.  
If you run into errors with the commands just take out `python3 -m` at the beginning and just use `pip install <package>`. 

1. Install Django through Pip: `python3 -m pip install Django`. 
2. Install postgress support through Pip: `python3 -m pip install psycopg2`
You can use these pip commands to install other packages and dependencies as needed.  
3. Install the Django database urls module. This will connect your application to a database url (postgres in our case). `python3 -m pip install dj_database_url` 

## Portfolio Web Application: Add the Projects application to your Django project
Start the tutorial [here](https://realpython.com/get-started-with-django-1/#showcase-your-projects), completing the **Showcase Your Projects** section.  
We have already done the first part of the tutorial with the code provided here but if you would like to start from the beginning later on your own, we highly encourage it!  
Note: All references to the previous 'Hello World' section have been removed from our starter code. 

### Some useful Django commands:
`python3 manage.py runserver` - This starts up the application locally.  
`python3 manage.py makemigrations <app>` - This makes the migration when you create new models for the database schema.  
`python3 manage.py migrate` - This will migrate all the changes to the database.  
`python3 manage.py shell` - This will open a shell where you can connect the app to the database and save objects directly.  

### Heroku  
[Getting Started With Python](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python)
[Heroku Working With Django](https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/working-with-django)   
[Deploying with Git](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git) 
[Heroku + Postgres](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgresql)  

Coming soon in the next session we will explore using Heroku. You are encouraged to skip ahead and learn on your own!
